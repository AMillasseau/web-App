# Board Game Catalog

## Goal

This project aims to make a small and simple catalog for a board game association which wishes to borrow some of their games.

## Methods

To make this application, I used the framework Next.js from Vercel to make and host the site and I associate it with a Postgres database for the data storing.
The majority of the code is made in Javascript and Typescript.

## Architecture

The application is structured around the main page, the catalog. This first page read the informations of the games from the database, the list indicates which games are available and via a button permits users to send a request to borrow a game.
A page "Credits" is accesible from the bottom of the site and contains informations about the association and the application.
The last page "Ask us" contains a little form to send messages which will be stored in the database.
